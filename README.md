## Synopsis

This repo contains my response to the final coding assignment set in https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning.  This project was to consolidate and summarise
data from an experiment where subjects wore a Samsung phone and performed various activities.  

## Use

Download the following data set:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Place the run_analysis.R in the main folder of the unzipped data set - "getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset\UCI HAR Dataset\"

Change the working directory of R to that directory, then source run_analysis.R

Execute the function by entering run_analaysis()

This will run a function that will return "OK" when it is complete.  The file summarised_output.txt will be generated in the folder.  

Please see the CodeBook.md for details of the transformations and output fields.  

## Motivation

This repo exists for examination purposes and has no value beyond being my course work.

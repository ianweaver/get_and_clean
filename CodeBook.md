## File structure
This project consists of one function in one run_analysis.R file.  Please see README.md for more details.  

##Transformations

The function loads the test "./test/X_test.txt" and train "./train/X_train.txt" results using fread for speed and consolidates them into one large file using row_bind.  
The features file "features.txt" is loaded and then the function determines which measurements are to be retained by looking for column names ending mean() or std().
These columns are then selected and the names applied without the trailing ().  

The function loads the activity id labels for test "./test/y_test.txt" and train "./train/y_train.txt" and consolidates them into one large file using row_bind.  
This is joined to the activity labels file "./activity_labels.txt" to give a long descriptive list of all the activities.  

The subject ids are loaded for test "./test/subject_test.txt" and train "./train/subject_train.txt" and consolidated into one large file using row_bind.  

These three sets are consolidated into one large file using bind_cols with the below columns.  THe output file "./summarised_output.txt", contains the same columns
grouped by subject_id and activity_label and summarised for the others by taking a mean.

##Further Description

The below is quoted from the data set.  The mean and the standard deviation was of these values was supplied therein.  We further averaged those for the final output.  

===============
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
